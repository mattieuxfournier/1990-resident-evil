    <u> When your in the Dining Room :</u> <br>
    When you gain control of Jill, head west to meet up with Barry. After the cutscene, turn around and use the nearby door.
    <br>
    <br>
     <u>When your in the Piano Room Hallway :</u> <br>
     Head west down the hallway. After the cutscene, turn around, head east down the hallway and use the first door on your right.
     <br>
     <br>
     <u>When your in the Dining Room :</u> <br>
     After the cutscene, head east and use the double doors at the end.
     <br>
     <br>
     <u>When your in the Main Hall :</u> <br>
     After the cutscene, head east and use the double doors at the end.
     <br>
     <br>
     <u>When your at the Golden Arrow :</u> <br>
     Head into the hall and you'll find Kenneth's corpse. Search it and collect the video tape. Move past it and through the door. You'll find yourself in a hall. The table with the bird cage has Handgun ammo. Also collect the two herbs.
    <br>
    <br>
     Head upstairs and through the door. You'll see a corpse immediately in front of you. Ignore it for now. Instead, head toward the mirror and stand right next to it, facing the camera. See the zombie in the mirror? He's waiting to ambush you just off the frame. Raise your gun and shoot until he drops once. Then rush past and up the hall. Grab the Golden Arrow and the Handgun magazine. Be wary of a second zombie hiding just off frame to your left
     <br>
     <br>
     If you're careful, you can lure him into a lunge then rush past his shoulder, dodging his second grab. This technique is a great ammo-saving method, and is recommended throughout your adventure.
     <br>
     <br>
     Once past him, head to the right-hand door. You'll be on a balcony. There's a zombie at the far end of the balcony. You can safely evade him, but don't forget he hangs around up here. Grab the dagger nearby. On the far end of the balcony is a statue holding a Blue Gem. Push it to the open rail and then off the balcony's edge so it breaks on the floor below you. Don't worry about heading back down for it just yet.
     <br>
     <br>
     Head through the double doors to the main lobby. Headup the short flight of stairs and when the camera angle changes, head through the door infront of you to access the graveyard. Dodge the zombie here and head toward the tomb with the archer statue. Examine your Golden Arrow and it will become an Arrowhead. Use the Arrowhead and you'll gain access to the Crypt. Head into the Crypt and follow the camera to the back and take the Book of Curses off the stand. Flip it over and examine it and you'll get the Sword/Mansion Key.
